### How to add tutorials
Please add each tutorial in the appropriate directory (use your spidey senses to figure out where it fits, or make a new one if it's missing), and make a subfolder inside for the tutorial, in the case that there are additional input files.  If not, feel free to put it directly in the main folder.  Basically just keep this organized, and do what you think is best.  Then, add your tutorial to the README.md in the specified folder.
