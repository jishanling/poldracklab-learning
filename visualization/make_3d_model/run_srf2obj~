# This uses freesurfers mri_convert to convert a surface file (.srf)
# to an .asc file.  A .asc file is essentially the same as .srf, so we
# just rename.  We can then use the script srf2obj to convert from
# srf to obj, and an obj file.  I did not figure this out, credit to:

# Convert from surface to asc
mris_convert $1 $1.asc

# Rename to srf
mv $1.asc $1.srf

# Now convert to obj
./srf2obj $1.srf > $1.obj
